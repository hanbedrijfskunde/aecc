## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Maintain existing code style

### Testing Protocol
1. Test each fix in isolation
2. Verify no regressions in other features
3. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Validate accessibility with screen reader

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch for each issue
git checkout -b fix/issue-3-modal-content

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "fix: populate week detail modals with JSON content"

# Push and create PR
git push origin fix/issue-3-modal-content
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers
1. **Content structure changes**: Coordinate with content team before modifying JSON
2. **Browser compatibility**: Test clipboard API fallbacks
3. **Performance**: Monitor for lag with animations/visualizations
4. **Accessibility conflicts**: Ensure visual enhancements don't break screen readers

### Fallback Plans
- If triangle visualization is too complex: Start with static image
- If onboarding tile is too complex: Create simple help card first
- If mobile fixes break desktop: Use progressive enhancement approach

---

## Future Considerations (Post-Backend)

Once backend is implemented, revisit:
- Issue #1: Dynamic progress tracking
- Issue #2: Assignment submission system
- User authentication and personalization
- Data persistence across sessions
- Real-time collaboration features

---

## Total Estimated Time: 48 hours

### Resource Requirements
- 1 Frontend Developer (full-time for 3 weeks)
- UI/UX Designer consultation (4 hours for onboarding flow)
- Content review from teaching team (2 hours)
- Testing support (4 hours total)

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve workplan
2. Set up development environment
3. Create feature branches
4. Begin with Sprint 1 critical fixes
5. Deploy fixes incrementally for immediate impact
