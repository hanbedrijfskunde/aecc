### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `script.js` and `script.test.js` in the same directory).
- Use browser developer tools for testing since this is a pure frontend application.
- All files should follow the multi-page architecture defined in the PRD.
